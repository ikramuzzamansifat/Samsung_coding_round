Idea: 
1. first we will see whether a row is exist twice or more..   (Using map) 
2. Then we will see every possible row type, whether that row is possible by inverting k times into all 1's.   
3. If possible-  We will check if it is > mx. then we will update it with mx. If(k>=noz && (k-noz)%2==0)
4. print(mx)
